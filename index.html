            <h2>Parenting</h2>
            <p>Ever since I only dreamed about my baby I tried to prepare myself the best way I could. I gathered information
                about parenting and what I thought might help me become a good parent. Of course, nothing really prepared
                me for this new challenge.</p>

                    <h3>Choosing My Baby Girl's Name</h3>
                    <p>
                        When my husband and I decided to have a baby we thought it will not be so difficult. Wrong! It took us almost five years
                        of trying, going to doctors and praying . When we almost lost hope we decided to go to a monastery
                        with somebody who was ill so that person could pray for her health. Of course, we also prayed to
                        God to bless us with a baby. The most interesting thing happened on that trip. We saw a lot of rainbows.
                        It was really strange. I only saw a few rainbows in my life until that moment. Two months after this
                        trip we went on our summer holiday. The weather was terrible .It was a heavy rain and after driving
                        for 10 hour we finally got to our destination. The rain stopped and from our balcony we could see
                        two rainbows over the sea. After we got back home I found out I was pregnant. When we knew that our
                        baby was going to be a girl we started searching for names and their meaning. We found out that the
                        name
                        <span>&quot;</span>Iris
                        <span>&quot;</span>means rainbow. In that moment we knew that this was going to be our baby girl's name.

                    <h3>Babywearing and Its Benefits</h3>
                    <p>
                        Babywearing is the practice of wearing or carrying a baby in a sling or in another form of carrier. Babywearing has been
                        practiced for centuries around the world. In the industrialized world, babywearing has gained popularity
                        in recent decades. Part of the reason for this shift is due to the influence of advocates of attachment
                        parenting. Babywearing is a form of baby transport which can be enjoyed for as long as mutually desired,
                        often until toddlerhood and beyond .
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Happy Babies. It’s true … carried babies cry less!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Healthy Babies. Premature babies and babies with special needs often enter the world with fragile nervous systems. When a
                        baby rides in a sling attached to his mother, he is in tune with the rhythm of her breathing, the
                        sound of her heartbeat, and the movements his mother makes—walking, bending, and reaching. This stimulation
                        helps him to regulate his own physical responses.

                        Confident Parents. A large part of feeling confident as a parent is the ability to read our babies’ cues successfully.

            <h2>Software Development</h2>
            <p>
                My newest passion is Software Development. Because I really wanted to change my career I found myself searching for new opportunities.
                I found out about
                <a href="http://scoalainformala.ro/" target="_blank" title="Go to site">Scoala Informala de IT</a> and I received many positive opinions about it. When I got the information that
                they are opening the school in Brasov I just knew it was the chance I was waiting for. I decided to start
                with the
                <span>&quot;</span>Intro in IT
                <span>&quot;</span>course and I was in for a big surprise. The Software Development part was very exciting. So,
                after finishing the course I chose the next course :
                <span>&quot;</span>Front-End Web Development
                <span>&quot;</span>.

                <h2>Food</h2>
                <p>
                    I am not sure if I should call my passion for food a new passion rather than an old one. Maybe as old as me. I have to admit
                    I love food. Lately I discovered that I can do really good baked specialties so maybe I will just say
                    that my passion for food and cooking are old and the passion for baking is new.

                    <h3>Spices</h3>
                    <p>
                        A spice is a seed, fruit, root, bark, or other plant substance primarily used for flavoring, coloring or preserving food.
                        Spices are distinguished from herbs, which are the leaves, flowers, or stems from plants used for
                        flavoring or as a garnish. Sometimes, spices may be ground into a powder for convenience. Many spices
                        have antimicrobial properties. This may explain why spices are more commonly used in warmer climates,
                        which have more infectious diseases, and why the use of spices is prominent in meat, which is particularly
                        susceptible to spoiling. Spices are sometimes used in medicine, religious rituals, cosmetics or perfume
                        production, or as a vegetable.

                    <h3>Main Course</h3>
                    <p>
                        The main course is the featured or primary dish in a meal consisting of several courses. It usually follows the entrée ("entry")
                        course. In the United States and Canada (except Quebec) , the main course may be called "entrée".
                        English-speaking Québécois follow the French use of the term. According to linguist Dan Jurafsky,
                        North American usage ("entrée") retains the original French meaning of a substantial meat course.The
                        main dish is usually the heaviest, heartiest, and most complex or substantial dish on a menu. The
                        main ingredient is usually meat, fish or another protein source. It is most often preceded by an
                        appetizer, soup or salad, and followed by a dessert.

                    <h3>Cakes and Cookies</h3>
                    <p>
                        Cake is a form of sweet dessert that is typically baked. In its oldest forms, cakes were modifications of breads, but cakes
                        now cover a wide range of preparations that can be simple or elaborate, and that share features with
                        other desserts such as pastries, meringues, custards, and pies. Typical cake ingredients are flour,
                        sugar, eggs, butter or oil or margarine, a liquid, and leavening agents, such as baking soda or baking
                        powder. Common additional ingredients and flavourings include dried, candied, or fresh fruit, nuts,
                        cocoa, and extracts such as vanilla, with numerous substitutions for the primary ingredients. Cakes
                        can also be filled with fruit preserves,nuts or dessert sauces (like pastry cream), iced with buttercream
                        or other icings, and decorated with marzipan, piped borders, or candied fruit.
